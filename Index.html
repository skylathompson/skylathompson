<h2>What is a pet?</h2>
<p>A pet is a companion animal which is an animal that lives with you in your home like a dog or cat.</p>
<p>Companion animals are a result of domestication. They live with us because they fulfill our needs as well.</p>
<p>They can provide us comfort, friendship and responsibility.</p>
